N.B:------------
Note: I apologize for submitting the assignment incomplete. My personal computer is not suitable for 3D editing. Whenever I reload the page or make changes to the Three.js canvas, it takes a significant amount of time for the changes to load. Additionally, loading models on my computer also requires a considerable amount of time.

Due to these limitations, I haven't been able to fully explore Three.js and I'm unable to add more functions to it
